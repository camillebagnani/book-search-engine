# Book Search Engine

## Description
This Book Search Engine was refactored by me in order to practice and understand the difference between RESTful APIs and GraphQL. It taught me how to set up type defs and resolvers in the back end so that I could define queries and mutations that would be called on the front end to create, read, update and delete data (CRUD) using GraphQL. This application also utilizes Mongoose to manage relationships in the MongoDB database and Node.js. This project also taught me how to be thorough and have a sharp attention to detail because I had to make sure everything was switched from RESTful API to GraphQL in order to avoid errors and function after the switch.
